# GPT-NeoX + ppc64le = ❤️

This README is a collection of notes I took while installing PyTorch and GPT-NeoX on ppc64le architecture (Lassen).  

Eric Hallahan sent me a really good summary of previous efforts that were made to get a stripped-down version of GPT-NeoX up and running on ppc64le. Most of this README is cannibalized from his work (https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/pull/456):  

## GPT-NeoX Requirements
six  
regex  
numpy>=1.20.0  
git+git://github.com/willzywiec/DeeperSpeed.git#egg=deepspeed (modified slightly)  
transformers>=4.5.0  
tokenizers>=0.10.0  
lm_dataformat>=0.0.19  
ftfy>=6.0.0  
~~lm_eval~~  

## DeeperSpeed Requirements
mpi4py  

## Dependencies
PyTorch --> Must install from source (hard) --> **DONE**  
~~Triton --> Must install from source (easy) --> **IN PROGRESS**~~ **ABANDONED!** (based on recommendation from Eric H. and Stella Biderman)  
~~Eigen~~  
~~DyNet --> Must install from source (hard)~~  
~~PyArrow~~  

## Notes
* I used Anaconda and Python 3.8 to install PyTorch 1.8 from Oregon State University's Open Source Lab without too many problems (https://osuosl.org/services/powerdev/opence/). I did encounter an SSL certificate error, which I was able to fix (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31729076/conda-ssl-error).
* I unsuccessfully tried to install Triton (https://github.com/openai/triton). The output included several C++17 errors, which were being generated by an out-of-date version of gcc 4.9.3 (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60336940/g-error-unrecognized-std-c17-what-is-g-version-and-how-to-install). I'm installing a newer local version of gcc right now... Maybe I'll come back to this later.
* I ignored lm_eval and its dependencies and stepped through installing everything else. The build tried to unsuccessfully install mpi4py 3.0.3, so I had to manually install 3.1.3 from conda-forge and comment the version out of the GPT-NeoX requirements.
