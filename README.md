## Notes
* I used Anaconda and Python 3.8 to install PyTorch 1.8 from Oregon State University's Open Source Lab without too many problems (https://osuosl.org/services/powerdev/opence/). I did encounter an SSL certificate error, which I was able to fix (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31729076/conda-ssl-error).
* I unsuccessfully tried to install Triton (https://github.com/openai/triton). The output included several C++17 errors, which were being generated by an out-of-date version of gcc 4.9.3 (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60336940/g-error-unrecognized-std-c17-what-is-g-version-and-how-to-install). I'm installing a newer version of gcc right now...
